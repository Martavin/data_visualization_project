# Predicting Attrition with Data Visulizations

In this project, I will use Data Visulization tools to present insight on employees who are likely to leave a company based on **Overtime Hours** and **Monthly Income**

## Project Overview 

This project uses Data Visulaliztioan tools such as 
- Boxplot
- Barchart
- Confusion Matrix
- Elbow Curve
- Kmean/Cluster

  The goal is to predict the leading cause of Attriution using key variables.

  ## Skills Demonstrated
  - Data anaylsis using **Pandas**
  - Data Visulizations with **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Confusion Matrix, Decision Tree, and sklearn.cluster**
  - Buliding and Interpreting a **LogisticRegression Model**
  - Writing and documenting Python code
 
    The data that was used for the project is known as "WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition" and is a fictional dataset found in IBM Human Resources Employee Anaytics Data Book. It includes
    - Age
    - BusinessTravel
    - Distance From home
    - Education
    - Attriution (Target Varible)
    - Overtime
    - Monthly Income
    - Gender
    - Job Satisfication
    - etc
